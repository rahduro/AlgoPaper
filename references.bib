abstract = "We study the problem of finding lowest common ancestors (LCA) in trees and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Specifically, we extend the \{LCA\} problem to \{DAGs\} and study the \{LCA\} variants that arise in this general setting. We begin with a clear exposition of Berkman and Vishkin's simple optimal algorithm for \{LCA\} in trees. Their ideas lay the foundation for our work on \{LCA\} problems in DAGs. We present an algorithm that finds all-pairs-representative \{LCA\} in \{DAGs\} in O ˜ ( n 2.688 ) operations, provide a transitive-closure lower bound for the all-pairs-representative-LCA problem, and develop an LCA-existence algorithm that preprocesses the \{DAG\} in transitive-closure time. We also present a suboptimal but practical O ( n 3 ) algorithm for all-pairs-representative \{LCA\} in \{DAGs\} that uses ideas from the optimal algorithms in trees and DAGs. Our results reveal a close relationship between the LCA, all-pairs-shortest-path, and transitive-closure problems. We conclude the paper with a short experimental study of \{LCA\} algorithms in trees and DAGs. Our experiments and source code demonstrate the elegance of the preprocessing-query algorithms for \{LCA\} in trees. We show that for most trees the suboptimal Θ ( n log n ) -preprocessing Θ ( 1 ) -query algorithm should be preferred, and demonstrate that our proposed O ( n 3 ) algorithm for all-pairs-representative \{LCA\} in \{DAGs\} performs well in both low and high density DAGs.
